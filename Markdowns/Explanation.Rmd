#### Influence Plot

#### Variance Factors

```
Variance factors are slightly more than 1 which proves the predictors are only slightly correlated but not enough to worry about colinearity.

#### McFadden's Pseudo R^2 Value
27.7% of the variability in the backwards Compatibility variable appears to be explained by the predictors in the model.

## Conclusions
Metacritic, having a version on Xbox One, a lower price, higher user reviews on Xbox's website, and having a demo are the most significant predictors with Uservoice votes lagging slightly behind. There was also moderate help by having a newer release date, more avatar items, less game add ons and more reviews. Retail only games are also negatively related and has a somewhat significant relation. Also, having a Kinect requirement or required peripherals brought the probablity to zero.

This makes me wonder if it is easier to test and approve games by usiner their demos. I am also glad that Uservoice votes positively significantly influenced their priorites. I am also not suprised they try to get higher reviewed games approved first. I imagine having a lower price and being available on their site makes them want to prioritize games people are likeliest to buy digitally on impulse.

## Future Work
* Implementing a method of machine learning called clustering to examine the data
* Implementing a neural network if given the time
* Automatically perform update scrape data and machine learning predictions
* Scraping sales to give consumers advice on which Xbox 360 games to buy that week
* Game covers are scraped but not implemented, which I feel would make the website prettier
